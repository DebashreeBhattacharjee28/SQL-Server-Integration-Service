## SQL-Server-Integration-Service
This repository has the content of one of my SSAS project that I have covered to gain an understanding of SSAS
## Description
The AdventureWorksDW is a sample data warehouse that was originally published by Microsoft to show how to design a SQL Server datawarehouse. It is a fictitious multinational company that sells products of various categories. Several attributes of the products are present based on which analysis can be performed for generating results related to profits made,sales per year ,geographical analysis ,etc. 

In this project analysis on AdventureworksDW was done to gain hands on of how a SSAS cube is generated and the way filtering is done based on Calender Year and Country from different dimensions are done to represent insights related to Sales Figures relative to Product Standard Cost amount in a year by quarter for Product Catergories.
